This dark theme makes vsCode EVEN Darker! The benefits of dark mode is that it will use up less energy (lights up less pixels), it is comfortable for your eyes (since it is less brighter) and it looks COOL!!

# Offline Installation
If you want to install the theme offline, you need the VISX file for installation which can be found [here]()

The extension has platform-specific binary dependencies, therefore installation via the Marketplace requires an Internet connection in order to download additional dependencies. If you are working on a computer that does not have access to the Internet or is behind a strict firewall, you may need to use our platform-specific packages and install them by running VS Code's "Install from VSIX..." command. These "offline' packages are available at: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools/releases.
