This dark theme makes vsCode Darker! The benefits of dark mode is that it will use up less energy (lights up less pixels), it is comfortable for your eyes (since it is less brighter) and it looks *COOL!!*

# Offline Installation
If you want to install the theme offline, you need the VISX file for installation which can be found [here](https://github.com/DamianBossPL/dark-extra/releases) and download **dark-extra-(VERSION_NUMBER).vsix**
Once you have downloaded the vsix file, open cmd and navigate to the directory that the file is in.
    
    Example: cd %USERPROFILE%\Downloads
Then run:
    
    code --install-extension (filename)
After that, hopefully you should have it.

# Online Installation
If you want to install it straight from the internet,
it is simple:
1. Open **Visual Studio Code**
2. Click **Extensions**

    **Windows/Linux:** Ctrl+Shift+X
    
    **OSX:** Command+Shift+X
3. Search **Dark Extra**
4. Click on the extension
5. Press **Install**

It should install automatically from the vsCode marketplace and apply itself. If it didn't, press **Set Color Theme** or **File >> Preferences >> Set Color Theme**. And you should have the theme installed. If you ever want to uninstall it, click **Uninstall** on the extension.
